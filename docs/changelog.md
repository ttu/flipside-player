## 2025-01-17 - Cross-Domain Deployment Support üåê

### Major Features Added

- **ADDED**: Full CORS support for cross-domain deployment (separate frontend/backend services)
- **ADDED**: Environment-aware session configuration (secure/sameSite handling)
- **ADDED**: Cross-domain authentication flow with proper cookie handling
- **ADDED**: Dual deployment architecture support (same-origin and cross-domain)
- **ENHANCED**: Device discovery with fallback handling for better user experience

### Deployment Patterns

**Same-Origin Deployment (Docker Compose):**
- Backend serves frontend static files via reverse proxy
- All requests appear from single origin
- Traditional session cookies work seamlessly

**Cross-Domain Deployment (Render, Vercel, Railway):**
- Frontend and backend on separate domains/services
- CORS headers enable cross-domain requests
- Secure cookies with SameSite=none for cross-domain authentication

### Technical Implementation

- **ADDED**: CORS middleware with origin-specific headers
- **ADDED**: Security headers for production deployment
- **ENHANCED**: Session configuration for cross-domain cookie support
- **ADDED**: Environment-based URL configuration (FRONTEND_URL, AUTH_BASE_URL)
- **FIXED**: OAuth callback to redirect to correct frontend domain
- **IMPROVED**: Device initialization with Web SDK fallback logic

### Environment Variables Added

**Backend:**
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Frontend domain for OAuth redirects and CORS
- Enhanced `NODE_ENV` handling for production cross-domain mode

**Frontend:**
- `VITE_AUTH_BASE_URL` - Separate auth URL for cross-domain deployments
- Enhanced `VITE_API_BASE_URL` handling for full URLs

### Files Modified

- `backend/src/server.ts` - Added CORS and security headers middleware
- `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` - OAuth callback redirect to frontend domain
- `backend/src/utils/spotify.ts` - Added user-read-playback-state scope
- `frontend/src/stores/authStore.ts` - Separated API and auth URLs
- `frontend/src/components/AlbumTrackList.tsx` - Device fallback handling
- `frontend/src/components/DevicePicker.tsx` - Enhanced device initialization
- `frontend/src/hooks/useSpotifyPlayer.ts` - Improved Web SDK error handling
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Fixed multi-stage build for production deployment
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added cross-domain environment variables

### Bug Fixes

- **FIXED**: "No Spotify device found" error with fallback device detection
- **FIXED**: Missing permissions error by adding required Spotify scopes
- **FIXED**: Session persistence in cross-domain production environments
- **FIXED**: Docker build issues with native module compilation (sodium-native)
- **FIXED**: Chrome security warnings with proper security headers

### Documentation Updates

- **UPDATED**: All documentation files for CORS cross-domain support
- **ENHANCED**: Setup instructions for both deployment patterns
- **ADDED**: Comprehensive debugging guide for CORS issues
- **IMPROVED**: Environment variable documentation with examples

### Major Changes

- **REMOVED**: JWT token-based authentication system

```

### Files Modified
